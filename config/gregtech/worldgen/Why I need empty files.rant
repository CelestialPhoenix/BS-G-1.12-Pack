Apparently someone with an empty skull decided that deleting empty files in empty folders is a good idea, except the empty files in the empty folders need to stay empty otherwise the worldgen files regenerate and make a big mess of things so heres some empty files to go in the empty folders to keep the empty skulls happy.
