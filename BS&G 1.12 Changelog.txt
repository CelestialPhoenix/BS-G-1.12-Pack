26.0 A bit of a Doozy!!
WARNING!:
This update contains significant changes to the overworld surface generation; 
--NuclearCraft wasteland biomes will lose their wasteland soils. This will make a complete mess of wasteland biomes. New chunks will have undamaged wastelands.
--Existing rubber trees (IC2) will dissapear, and Gregtech trees will generate in new chunks. This may produce some small lighting glitches that can be fixed with a block update.

When opening an existing world with this update- you'll get a warning about missing blocks/items. This message can be safely ignored.
This update changes to the mod list- items/blocks from IC2, NuclearCraft, and Thermal Dynamics will be lost!
(Immersivetech stuff will update perfectly fine).

Special thanks to Shattered for digging up more bugs than the NSA. Cheers bud!
