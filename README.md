#A few notes on contributions:

Don't forget to add your name to the 'authors' at the top of the script if you make a contribution.

Please refer to Gregtech meta-items with the ore dictionary tags `<ore:ringCopper>`, or as "meta-items" `<metaitem:conveyor.module.lv>`
(Ore tags are the preferred method)
Using the internal name `<gregtech:meta_item_1:14514>` is a bad idea, is this is generated from the material ID number- which can be changed between updates.
This will either break stuff, or use/produce the wrong items if that ID gets used elsewhere.
